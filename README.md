This project analyzes sleep, recovery, and training load data from the Oura ring and Strava wearable fitness tracking devices. It establishes a relationship between total daily distance and heart rate variability. It also implements a multivariate linear regression model to measure the influence of sleep and training load input variables on heart rate variability.
